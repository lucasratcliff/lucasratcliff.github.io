    <h><strong>About Me</strong></h>
    <p>My name is Lucas Ratcliff, I grew up in North Andover Mass. I go to the university of Rhode Island and my major is computer science. I played soccer for 2 years and track for 3 years in highschool and I love to surf and snowboard in the summer and winter. I grew up loving cars because my dad loved cars, so my first car was a project car with my dad. I love learning more about what computers can do and making my own programs and I hope to advance my knowledge in college.</p>
